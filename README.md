___
This study in 2 notebooks aims to estimate the feasability of exploiting <i>Open Food Facts</i>' database, containing more than a million food items, as part of a call for proposals by Santé publique France. 
The French national public health agency would like to be submitted with ideas for innovative applications on the theme of nutrition. 

Given the focus of the call to proposals, this pre-analysis will concentrate on three points :
- **The category of the food items** : their PNNS as well as NOVA groups and subgroups.
- **The nutritional values of the food items** : in particular, the big nutritional groups (proteins, fats and carbohydrates)

The study being carried out for Santé Publique France, the point of reference will be the products sold in France.
___

This study is divided into 2 notebooks: 
- A cleaning up notebook
- An analysis notebook

## Requirements

This assumes that you already have an environment allowing you to run Jupyter notebooks. 

The libraries used otherwise are listed in requirements.txt

_________

## Usage

1. The dataset is quite massive. Therefore, the notebook is configured to use a local version of the dataset, saved on disk after the very first download via Pandas. 
Therefore, you can either : 
    - Download the dataset from [Open Food Facts' official website](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/data), and place it at root level with name "open_food_facts_df.csv".
    - Uncomment the cell number 3 and comment cell number 4. This will fetch the data directly from Open Food Fact's website.

2. The data set and the signification of its columns are described in details on [Open Food Facts' official website](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/data/data-fields.txt)

3. Run the following in your terminal to install all required libraries :

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the notebooks in order (Notebook 1 first, then Notebook 2).
